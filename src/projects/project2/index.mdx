# it is what it is not 

no one <br />
no thing  <br />
no idea <br />
**can be interpreted with a single word to its full extent without an understanding behind the mastermind of its own.** 


every one <br />
every thing <br />
every idea <br />
**is created with a cause in mind, illuminated from an experience and is subjective to change.** 


share everything <br />
share nothing <br />
share <br />
**to understand all of the above.**

Blend of chaotic thoughts and reasoned ideas.

Unconstraint and spontaneous visualization of internal monologues.

Expression of your impression.
