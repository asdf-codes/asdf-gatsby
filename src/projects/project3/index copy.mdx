# more with less


**what?**
We help people put their ideas on the internet.

**how? **
We are familiar with the available technologies. Do you have a product you want to sell online? Would grandma like to learn Instagram? How about blockchain? You have an idea - we have a solution.

**why?** 
The short answer is because we want **to help**. The long answer is because there are a lot of ideas in the world that are not getting proper attention. Every day, hundreds and thoughts of Ph.D. papers are published, startups started, and shower-thoughts abandoned. We all have ideas. When was the last time you had one? Do you ~~really~~ need a reason? 

**when?** 
Established. 2020 

**where?**
Ottawa ON, Canada, "ey!?"
